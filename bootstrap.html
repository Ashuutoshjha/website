        <h1>JOURNEY OF INDIAN CRICKET TEAM </h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="container">
            <p>
                The India men's national cricket team, also known as Team India or the Men in Blue,[10][11] represents
                India
                in men's international cricket. It is governed by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), and
                is a
                Full Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) with Test, One Day International (ODI) and
                Twenty20
                International (T20I) status.

                Cricket was introduced to the Indian subcontinent by British sailors in the 18th century, and the first
                cricket club was established in 1792. India's men's national cricket team played its first international
                match on 25 June 1932 in a Lord's Test against England becoming the sixth team to be granted Test
                cricket
                status. India had to wait until 1952, almost twenty years, for its first Test victory. In its first
                fifty
                years of international cricket, success was limited, with only 35 wins in 196 Tests.[12] The team,
                however,
                gained strength in the 1970s with the emergence of players like Sunil Gavaskar, Gundappa Viswanath,
                Kapil
                Dev, and the Indian spin quartet.

                In men's limited-overs cricket, India made its ODI and T20I debuts in 1974 and 2006, respectively. The
                team
                has won five major ICC tournaments, winning the Cricket World Cup twice (1983 and 2011), the ICC T20
                World
                Cup once (2007) and the ICC Champions Trophy twice (2002 and 2013) and have also finished as runners-up
                in
                the World Cup once (2003), the T20 World Cup once (2014), and the Champions Trophy twice (2000 and
                2017).
                The team were also part of ICC World Test Championship finals in the first two editions (2019–21,
                2021–23).
                It was the second team after the West Indies to win the World Cup and the first team to win the World
                Cup on
                home soil after winning the 2011 Cricket World Cup.

                They have also won the Asia Cup seven times, in 1984, 1988, 1990–91, 1995, 2010, 2016 and 2018, whilst
                finishing runners-up thrice (1997, 2004, 2008). The team also won the 1985 World Championship of
                Cricket,
                defeating Pakistan in the final. Other achievements include winning the ICC Test Championship Mace five
                times and the ICC ODI Championship Shield once.

                As of June 2023, the team is ranked first in Tests, third in ODIs and first in T20Is in the ICC
                rankings.[13]

            <h2>The Fearless Captains Of ICT</h2>
            <p>
                Sourav Ganguly became the regular captain of the men's team in both Tests and ODIs in 2000.[122] He
                remained captain until 2005–06 and became the then most successful Indian captain, winning 21 of his 49
                Test matches in charge and 76 of his 146 ODIs. Under his captaincy, India became the joint-winners of
                the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy with Sri Lanka, and the runners-up of the 2003 Cricket World Cup. India
                lost only three Tests at home under Ganguly and managed to draw Test series in England and Australia.
                Rahul Dravid took over as men's Test captain in 2005. In 2006, he led India to its first Test series
                victory in the West Indies in more than 30 years.
                <br>
                <br>

                In September 2007, MS Dhoni was named as the new captain of the men's ODI and Twenty20 International
                teams, after Dravid stepped down from the post. Soon after taking up the captaincy, Dhoni led the team
                to the inaugural World men's Twenty20 title. Anil Kumble was appointed Test captain in November 2007,
                but retired from international cricket in November 2008 after captaining in 14 Tests. Dhoni succeeded
                him as the men's Test captain, making him the captain in all formats. Under the captaincy of Dhoni, the
                Indian men's cricket team held the number one position in the ICC Men's Test Team Rankings for 21 months
                (from November 2009 to August 2011), and set a national record for most back-to-back ODI wins (nine
                straight wins).[124] Dhoni also led the team to victory in 2011 Cricket World Cup and 2013 ICC Champions
                Trophy. Thus, Dhoni became the first captain in history to win all three major ICC trophies, namely- ICC
                Cricket World Cup in 2011, ICC Men's T20 World Cup in 2007 and ICC Champions Trophy in 2013.[125]
                However, the team performed poorly in away Tests from 2011 to 2014 and Dhoni retired from Test cricket
                in December 2014, with Virat Kohli being named as the new Test captain.[126] Dhoni resigned as captain
                of the ODI and T20I teams in January 2017 and Kohli succeeded him at the position.
                <br>
                <br>

                Under Kohli's captaincy, India was unbeaten in 19 Test matches, starting from a 3–0 series win over New
                Zealand and ending with a 2–1 series win over Australia. India also had an unbeaten streak of winning 9
                consecutive Test series, starting with a 3–0 series win over Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka and ending with a
                1–0 series win over Sri Lanka at home. India also became only the third team after Australia and South
                Africa to have won their most recent Test series simultaneously against all the other Test playing
                nations. As per winning percentage in Test matches, Kohli was India's second most successful Test
                captain, behind Ajinkya Rahane, having won more than 58% of Test matches (at least 2 games).
                <br>
                <br>

                In November 2021, Rohit Sharma was appointed as the new T20I captain of the Indian men's cricket team
                after Kohli resigned from the role.[129] Kohli led India one last time in T20Is at the T20 World Cup
                2021. Under Rohit's first series as permanent captaincy, India whitewashed New Zealand at home in the
                T20I series 3–0.[130] In December 2021, Sharma was also appointed as the new ODI captain of the Indian
                men's cricket team, replacing Kohli ahead of their away series against South Africa.[131] Kohli later
                quit as Test captain as well, after their Test series loss to South Africa.[132] Sharma replaced Kohli
                as Test captain before the Test series against Sri Lanka[133] and is now the Full-Time Captain of the
                Indian men's cricket team.

            <h3>The Fascinating Jerseys Of ICT</h3>
            <p>
                The 1999 World Cup edition was held in England and attended by 12 teams from all around the globe. This
                tournament followed Super Six format in which 6 teams were divided into two groups. India finished
                second in
                the group, but performed very poorly in Super Six and won only one match. In the end, Australia defeated
                Pakistan in the final after a tough semifinal against South Africa.
                Jersey- The Indian jersey this time was similar to the 1996 version. However, this time the yellow
                colour
                was more noticeable. The diagonal yellow pattern with a black border went across the chest while the
                rest of
                the jersey was blue. The collar was yellow again, but the border was black.
                2003 - Blue colour Jersey with tri-colour and black sides
                <br>
                <br>

            <h4>2003 world cup jersey</h4>

            </div>


            Apart from 2011 and 1983, the 2003 World Cup hosted by South Africa was one of India's most successful
            campaigns. A total of 14 teams participated, divided into two groups. The format of this world cup was
            similar
            to that
            of the Super Six in 1999, after the group stage. India performed very well throughout the tournament and
            advanced to the final to face Australia. However, they were easily defeated by Australia as the team won the
            title for the second consecutive year.
            Jersey- In this World Cup, the Indian jersey was a major upgrade from its predecessor and was loved by fans,
            as the word "India" was present on the chest part with a tricolour striped background. Indian jersey has
            witnessed a dramatic change, with blue becoming darker and yellow disappearing.
            2007 - Again Light Blue Jersey but totally different design and with tri-colour.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>World Cup 2007</h4>
            <div class="text-center">
                <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2007.jpg?resize=680%2C382&ssl=1"

            </div>
            So far, the 2007 World Cup held in the West Indies, was India's worst World Cup ever. Despite being
            favorites at the beginning, India was overthrown by Bangladesh in the first game. They continued to lose to
            Sri Lanka and were eliminated from the tournament. This loss shocked many cricket fans who chosen India as a
            favorite that year, especially after becoming a finalist in the previous edition. India finished third in
            the group stage and did not make it to Super 8. In the final, Australia defeated Sri Lanka and claimed the
            World Cup for the third consecutive year.
            Jersey- This year the pale blue colour made a comeback in the Indian jersey. It can be said that this is
            India's neatest jersey so far on which "India" was written in bold yellow.

            The 2011 World Cup is unforgettable for Indian fans as after a long twenty-eight years gap, India lifted the
            World Cup trophy. Team India defeated Sri Lanka by 6 wickets in the final to win their second title at
            Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. 14 teams participated in the game who were divided into two groups of 7 each;
            the top 4 from each group entered the quarterfinals.
            Yuvraj Singh was named "the man of the tournament" for his outstanding all-round performance. However, this
            victory is more special than other aspects. This was Sachin Tendulkar's first World Cup win after serving
            the national team for 24 years. The victory became even sweeter because it came from his hometown Mumbai.
            2011 World Cup final is also remembered for the match-winning six shot by MS Dhoni.
            Jersey - In this edition, India's jersey remained the same as previous, with only minor changes in colour
            and position. The most obvious change was the saffron colour "India" across the chest.
            2015 - Blue and Saffron Jersey made out of recycled bottles

            Australia and New Zealand co-hosted the 2015 World Cup. Coincidentally, these two teams also qualified for
            the finals of this edition in which Australia again clinched the World Cup trophy for the fifth time and
            became five-time world champions.
            India was unbeaten in the group stage and did not lose a single match. They easily defeated Bangladesh in
            the quarterfinals but lost to Australia by 95 runs in the semifinals.
            Jersey - Sports brand Nike designed Indian team’s jersey for this World Cup using 33 recycled plastic
            bottles to raise awareness to protect the environment. The jersey was similar to the 2011 edition’s design,
            only the white border was added.

            series.
            Jersey- This was the first time in sports history that a team (India) wore jersey with their mothers'
            name
            on the back. It was done to highlight the importance of mothers in everyone’s lives.

            England and Wales hosted the 2019 World Cup. There were ten teams in total to participate in the
            tournament. The format was similar to the 1992 format where the round-robin format was revived after 27
            years.
            The
            top four teams in the semifinals were India, New Zealand, England and Australia. Throughout the game,
            India's performance was consistent, but in the semifinals, India was ousted by New Zealand. Due to the rain,
            the
            match lasted two days.
            Jersey - India's jersey for 2019 World Cup looked probably the smartest, with dark blue shades occupying
            most of the T-shirts and pants. The word "India" continues to appear across the chest.
            <br>
            <br>
            Indian cricket team has long been using blue jersey, but in some of the matches during this world cup 2019,
            team
            will be seen in saffron Jersey. As per the rules adopted by the International Cricket
            Council (ICC), the teams that is sporting a similar colour jersey to that of their opposition, will have to
            adopt a different colour kit.

                <h2>The Glorious History Of ICT</h2>
                <p>

                    Indian cricket team in action at Wankhede Stadium
                    The Indian team underwent major improvements under the captaincy of Sourav Ganguly and guidance of
                    John Wright, India's first foreign coach.[45][46] In the Kolkata Test match, India became only the
                    third team in the history of Test cricket to win a Test match after following on. Australian captain
                    Steve Waugh labelled India as the "Final Frontier" because of his side's inability to win a Test
                    series in India.[47] In the year 2002, India were joint-winners of the ICC Champions Trophy with Sri
                    Lanka and then went to the 2003 Cricket World Cup in South Africa, where they reached the final,
                    only to be beaten by Australia. A convincing ODI series win in Pakistan in early 2006, following a
                    loss in the Test series, gave India the world record of 17 successive ODI victories while batting
                    second.[48]

                    Indian players celebrating after taking a wicket against New Zealand in 2010
                    In September 2007, India won the first-ever ICC Men's T20 World Cup held in South Africa, beating
                    Pakistan by 5 runs in the final.[49] On 2 April 2011, India won the 2011 Cricket World Cup by
                    defeating Sri Lanka in the final, thus becoming the third team after West Indies and Australia to
                    win the World Cup twice.[50] India also became the first team to win the World Cup on home soil.[51]
                    India defeated England in the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy Final and Dhoni became the first men's
                    cricket team captain in history to win the three major ICC trophies, namely the Cricket World Cup,
                    ICC Men's T20 World Cup and ICC Champions Trophy. India then began 2016 by winning the 2016 Asia
                    Cup, remaining unbeaten throughout the
                    tournament.[56]



                    2023, As per Aakash Chopra, in the last three years’ test, the current captain of team India had
                    taken part in 18 matches and scored with a 42+ average, which is the highest average in test matches
                    by an Indian batsman apart from Rishabh Pant. Additionally, Indian young player Shubhman Gill played
                    16 matches and scored a 32 average; KL Rahul participated in 11 test matches and scored a 30
                    average; India’s test specialist Cheteshwar Pujara played 28 matches and scored a 29 average; and
                    similarly, the backbone of the Indian batting department, Virat Kohli, has a 29 average after
                    playing 25 matches. However, Ajinkya Rahne, who had been recalled for the World Test Championship
                    final on the basis of his IPL performance, has managed a 26 average after 20 matches in the last
                    three years of tests.[64]

            <h3>The learning phase</h3>
            <p>
                In the 2014 ICC Men's World Twenty20 hosted in Bangladesh, India narrowly missed out on another
                ICC trophy by losing to Sri Lanka in the final.[54] India was knocked out of the 2015 Cricket World Cup
                in the semi-final to eventual winners Australia. The team were favourites to win the 2016 ICC
                World Twenty20, which was being held at home, but lost in the semi-final to eventual champions West
                Indies.[57] India defeated Pakistan in their first game of the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy but lost to
                the same opponents in the final, the first time they had met at this stage of a tournament since
                2007. The Indian team's next major global tournament was the 2019 Cricket World Cup where the team
                finished first in the group stage with 7 wins and only 1 loss which came against host nation
                England.[60] They made the semis but lost to New Zealand by 18 runs.[61] Rohit Sharma was the
                highest run-scorer for the team with 648 runs. India played the 2021 ICC World Test Championship
                Final against New Zealand in Southampton in which they lost by 8 wickets.[62] India qualified for
                the semi-finals in the 2022 T20 World Cup, but lost to England by 10 wickets.[63]
